# 🧠 Marketing Asset Review

A precision-built prompt for Copilot Studio Agents or ChatGPT designed to review and optimise marketing assets - including emails, landing pages, and customer journeys — using lifecycle strategy, persona insight, UX/UI heuristics, and language localisation.

Ideal for those who are time poor and want to benchmark their work with a  structured, conistent review of assets.

(The prompt is too long to use in a normal chat, so creating in a Project or Agent is neccesary.)
